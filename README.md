# Our Mission... 
To ensure all hospice patients 
are able to die with dignity, free 
of pain, in the setting they 
choose.
## What is a Memorial Fund?
This is a charitable fund created 
for the purpose of receiving 
memorial donations in honor of 
someone who has passed 
away. All gifts received are tax-deductible and help fulfill our 
mission of caring for others.
## Why Should It Matter To Me?
Part of the pain of losing someone close to you comes in 
realizing they are gone from 
your life forever. How will you 
fill the void they have left 
behind? How will you keep their 
memory alive?
#
Leaving a gift in honor of a 
loved one provides a lasting 
memorial that will survive for 
years to come.
#
All gifts received by A Better 
Way Memorial Fund will be 
used for charitable purposes. 
We want to ensure that all 
people who need hospice care 
will be able to receive hospice 
care, regardless of their ability 
to pay.
# How Can I Help?
*In Lieu of Flowers:* When 
planning for a funeral, there is 
an opportunity to ask friends 
and family for charitable gifts in 
lieu of flowers. This can be 
done on an individual basis 
when speaking with friends and 
family, or it can be included as 
part of an obituary. A gift to A 
Better Way Memorial Fund will 
help those patients who need 
hospice care, but who may not 
be able to afford everything 
needed to ensure their comfort 
as they live out their remaining 
days.

### One-time Donations vs. Annual Donations:
We know 
the first year after a loved one 
passes away is difficult for those 
of us left behind. Anniversaries, 
birthdays and holidays tend to 
be the most difficult days.
It is common for memorial gifts to be 
made on the loved oneâ€™s 
birthday, anniversary, or their 
favorite holiday. This can be a 
one-time donation, or many 
people set up annual gifts on a 
specific date to honor their 
loved one each and every year. 
Both types of donations are 
deeply appreciated. If you 
would like to discuss your 
options, please do not hesitate 
to contact someone at A Better 
Way Memorial Fund. We are 
happy to help you with this 
process.
### Ongoing Support:
One of the 
long range goals of A Better 
Way Memorial Fund is to build a 
residential hospice facility in the 
Treasure Valley. There is only 
one residential hospice facility in 
the entire state of Idaho, and it 
is located in Post Falls. 
#
Currently, if a terminally ill 
patient does not want to die at 
home, the only choice they have 
is to die in a Skilled Nursing 
Facility or in a Hospital. Neither 
of these have a home-like 
setting, nor are they geared 
toward hospice patients and 
their unique needs, as well as 
the needs of the family.
<p>
As we work with members of 
this community to make our 
dream a reality, we welcome the 
assistance of anyone interested 
in getting involved. There are 
many ways to contribute your 
time, talents, and/or resources.
